React.js Notes

1. Introduction
	•	React → JavaScript library developed by Meta (Facebook).
	•	Used for building User Interfaces (UI), especially Single Page Applications (SPAs).
	•	Enables building reusable UI components using a component-based architecture.
	•	Helps maintain multiple dynamic processes within a single component.

⸻

2. Features of React
	•	Declarative → Describes what the UI should look like for a given state.
	•	Component-Based → UI divided into independent, reusable components.
	•	Virtual DOM → Speeds up updates by avoiding full-page reloads.
	•	One-Way Data Flow → Makes debugging and data tracking easier.
	•	Reusable Code → Components can be reused across applications.
	•	Cross-Platform → Available for both web and mobile (React Native).
	•	Community Support → Large ecosystem and active community.

⸻

3. Why React?
	•	Fast rendering with Virtual DOM.
	•	Component reusability.
	•	Easy debugging and maintenance.
	•	Supports modern JavaScript features (ES6+).
	•	Enables development of dynamic and scalable web applications.

⸻

4. Prerequisites

Before learning React, revise:
	•	JavaScript Fundamentals
	•	Scope & Closure
	•	Global & Local Variables
	•	Functions & Arrow Functions
	•	Promises, Callbacks, Async/Await
	•	Fetch API
	•	Hoisting
	•	Objects & Arrays
	•	Rest, Spread Operators
	•	Array Methods
	•	Destructuring
	•	ES6 Features
	•	let, const
	•	import/export modules
	•	Template literals
	•	Ternary operators

⸻

5. Core Concepts
	•	DOM Manipulation → Event listeners, form handling, etc.
	•	JSON → Converting data to and from objects.
	•	Local Storage / Session Storage → For client-side data storage.
	•	React → Built on pure JavaScript; understanding JS fundamentals is essential.

⸻

6. JSX (JavaScript XML)
	•	JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript.
	•	Used to write HTML elements inside JavaScript.
	•	Babel Compiler converts JSX and ES6+ code into browser-readable JavaScript.

⸻

7. Comparison Questions
	1.	Difference between HTML page and React page.
	2.	Difference between React and Angular.
	3.	What is TypeScript?
	4.	What is variable declaration and hoisting in JS?
	5.	Why use React in development?
	6.	Which is better: React, Angular, or Node?

⸻

8. JavaScript Engine
	•	V8 Engine → Executes JavaScript code by converting it to machine code for faster execution.
	•	React’s JSX files are compiled to JavaScript and executed by the V8 engine.
9. Project Setup

Create React App (CRA)
	•	Command:
npx create-react-app project-name
Basic and minimal setup.
	•	Recommended for React 3+ projects.

Vite
	•	Command:
npm create vite@latest project-name
Fast and lightweight alternative to CRA.
	•	Recommended for React 4+ projects.
	•	Uses Rollup and ESBuild for efficient bundling.

⸻

10. Package Managers
	•	npm (Node Package Manager) → Installs and manages dependencies.
	•	npx (Node Package Executor) → Executes packages directly.

⚔️ CRA vs Vite — The Comparison

Feature	                       CRA (Create React App)	                            Vite
🏗️ Build Tool	                    Uses Webpack	                        Uses ESBuild + Rollup
⚡ Speed	                    Slower to start and reload	            Super fast startup and instant reload
📦 Bundle Time	         Bundles everything before starting      	Serves files on demand (no full bundle)
🧠 Configuration	     Hidden/Complex (need eject to modify)          	Simple and easy to customize
🧩 Default Setup	          More boilerplate files	                        Cleaner, minimal setup
🧰 Plugin Support	          Fewer modern plugin options	             Supports many modern plugins easily
🔄 Hot Reload (HMR)	               Slower refresh	                     Very fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
🗂️ Folder Structure	    src, public, package.json, etc.	                 src, index.html, vite.config.js
🧱 Production Build	         Uses Webpack for final build	                Uses Rollup for optimized build
🚀 Used For	               Older React setups or beginners	             Modern, faster React + JS frameworks
🕒 First Released               	2016 by Facebook	                     2020 by Evan You (Vue creator)


🧩 CRA Folder Structure
my-app/
├─ public/
│  ├─ index.html
├─ src/
│  ├─ App.js
│  ├─ index.js
├─ package.json
├─ README.md
➡️ More boilerplate and slower dev server.


⚡ Vite Folder Structure
my-app/
├─ index.html
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.jsx
│  ├─ App.jsx
├─ package.json
├─ vite.config.js
➡️ Lighter, simpler, and much faster dev experience.
