1. Why was React introduced?
         React was introduced by Facebook to make building dynamic and interactive user interfaces easier and faster.
Problems before React:
         1.Updating the UI manually with plain JavaScript or jQuery was hard.
         2.Code became messy when the app grew bigger.
         3.Reusing components was difficult.
         4.React’s solution:
         5.Component-based structure (build small reusable UI blocks).
         6.Virtual DOM improves performance.
        7.One-way data flow makes debugging easier.

2. Difference between HTML webpage and React webpage

Feature         	        HTML Webpage	                          React Webpage
Structure	               Static HTML file	                 Dynamic components built with JavaScript
Data Update	        Manual (you edit HTML or use JS)	       Automatic (React updates DOM for you)
Reusability	                    Limited	                           High (components can be reused)
Speed	                  Slower for large apps	                      Faster due to Virtual DOM
Example	                       index.html	                            App.js, components/, etc.


3. Difference between React and Angular

Feature	                   React	                       Angular
Type	                  Library	                  Full Framework
Language	        JavaScript (or TypeScript)	        TypeScript
Learning Curve          	Easier	                      Steeper
DOM	                     Virtual DOM	             Real DOM (with change detection)
Data Binding	           One-way                      	Two-way
Managed By	           Meta (Facebook)	                     Google

4. What is TypeScript?
       TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript — it adds types to JavaScript code.
Example:
let name: string = "John"; // TypeScript
✅ It helps catch errors early and makes big projects easier to manage.
🛠 Compiles down to regular JavaScript.

5. What is Variable Declaration and Initialization?
           Declaration: Telling the program that a variable exists.
let name;
Initialization: Giving it a value.
name = "John";
You can also do both at once:
let name = "John";

6. What is Lexical Scope?
       Lexical scope means a variable is accessible based on where it’s written in the code (the code structure).
Example:
function outer() {
  let x = 10;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); // ✅ inner can access outer’s variable
  }
  inner();
}
outer();
Here, inner has lexical access to x.


7. What is Block Scope?
           Block scope means a variable is only available inside {} brackets where it’s defined.
Example:
{
  let x = 5;
  console.log(x); // ✅ works
}
console.log(x); // ❌ error (outside block)


8. What is Function Scope?
           In function scope, variables are available only inside that function.
Example:
function test() {
  var x = 10;
}
console.log(x); // ❌ x is not defined outside



9. What is Hoisting?
Hoisting means JavaScript moves declarations to the top of their scope before execution.
Example:
console.log(x); // undefined
var x = 5;

JS behaves like:
var x;
console.log(x);
x = 5;
(But with let and const, hoisting still happens but they stay in the temporal dead zone, so you get an error if you use them before declaration.)



10. Why is Node.js used in web development? Which came first — React, Angular, or Node?
Why Node.js:
Lets you use JavaScript on the server.
Handles requests efficiently (non-blocking I/O).
Used for building APIs and backend services.
Order of introduction:
AngularJS (2010)
Node.js (2009)
React (2013)
👉 So Node came first, then Angular, then React.

11. Vite vs CRA (Create React App)

Feature	                       Vite	                       CRA (Create React App)
Speed	           ⚡ Very fast (modern bundler)	        🐢 Slower (uses Webpack)
Build Tool	             ESBuild + Rollup	                       Webpack
Configuration	         Simple and modern	                     More complex
Default Files	         Fewer files, clean                 	More files and setup



🧠 What is a Closure?
           A closure happens when a function remembers variables from the place where it was created, even after that outer function has finished running.
🔍 Example:
function outer() {
  let counter = 0;  // variable inside outer
  function inner() {
    counter = counter + 1;
    console.log(counter);
  }
  return inner;  // returning inner function
}
const myCounter = outer();  // outer() runs once
myCounter();  // 1
myCounter();  // 2
myCounter();  // 3
🧩 How it works:
outer() runs → creates variable counter = 0.
inner() is created inside outer().
When outer() returns inner, the inner function remembers the variable counter from outer().
Even though outer() is done, the variable counter stays alive inside inner().
This “memory” is called a closure.
